Be daring. Ditch your go-to drink and try something new.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, API

A user can search for a drink by name, type, or ingredient. Leaving the input field returns a random drink.

Clicking the button returns the drink name, a picture, ingredients, and instructions from the data provided by the [Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

## Lessons Learned:

I don't drink ðŸ˜… so I'd love to work with the Non-Alcoholic database TheCocktailDB provided. But, there was more documentation for the Alcoholic options, so I worked with that.
